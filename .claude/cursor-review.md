## Pending

### 2026-07-01 — Package the desktop installer (for the clean-machine recording)
Mobile-first + START RUN all merged + David-verified on BOTH platforms (Android review session confirmed). Last Wednesday gap = the installer artifact. **Please build the packaged desktop installer** so David can run it in Windows Sandbox and record the clean-machine install:
- From `repos/anki` on `main`: `uv run python qt/tools/build_installer.py --version "$(cat .version)" build` then the `… package` step → produce the real `.exe`/`.msi` and report its exact output path + size.
- Confirm it builds with NO network submodule fetch (the Phase-0 vendoring should hold) and that `qt/tests/test_installer.py` still passes.
- Windows installer only (`.dmg` is out of scope — decided; macOS-CI is the documented fallback). Report the artifact path when done; Cursor updates `WEDNESDAY-DELIVERABLES.md`.
- Then you're clear to switch to grounding the **Friday brief** (`docs/plans/2026-07-03-friday-brief.md`) into a full plan for Cursor review (Thursday work — do whenever).

### 2026-07-01 — ✅ RESOLVED (was GATE FAIL): S1 desktop START RUN false "all caught up"
**Fixed (`f0a06ce68`) + David-verified 2026-07-01 20:35** — START RUN now launches a real review session (20 new cards due, dark reviewer confirmed on-screen). Fix used `col.sched.deck_due_tree(did)` + a characterization regression test. Merge to `main` pending only Claude's QA-sweep triage (bug-class hunt). Original report retained below.

### (original) 🐞 GATE FAIL (S1 desktop START RUN): false "all caught up"
David's smoke test caught a real bug. After importing the seed deck (coverage correctly shows 9/9), clicking **START RUN** shows **"ALL CAUGHT UP FOR TODAY"** even though the deck HAS due cards (he studied one via the normal Decks path — screenshot confirms a reviewable card).

**Root cause (grounded):** `SpeedrunHome._start_run` computes due from `self.mw.col.decks.deck_tree()`, which is the **structural** tree with **no scheduling counts** — its `new_count`/`review_count`/`learn_count` are 0. `pylib/anki/scheduler/legacy.py:114` literally says: *"use decks.deck_tree() for a tree without counts, or sched.deck_due_tree()."* So `due` is always 0 → false caught-up; real study never launches.

**Fix:** get the due counts from the scheduler, not the structural tree. `col.sched.deck_due_tree(did)` (overload `deck_due_tree(top_deck_id: DeckId) -> DeckTreeNode | None`, `pylib/anki/scheduler/base.py:74`) returns the deck's node WITH counts (or None). Suggested:
```python
did = self.mw.col.decks.id_for_name(self.EXAM_DECK)
if did is None: … importNeeded; return
node = self.mw.col.sched.deck_due_tree(did)      # scheduler tree = real counts
due = 0 if node is None else (node.new_count + node.review_count + node.learn_count)
if due == 0: … caughtUp(new_left); return
self.mw.col.decks.select(did); self.close(); self.mw.moveToState("review")
```
(Drop the `decks.find_deck_in_tree(decks.deck_tree(), …)` usage.) **Verify on Android S2 too** — the Kotlin path used `sched.deckDueTree().find(did)?.hasCardsReadyToStudy()`; that one likely IS the scheduler tree (correct), but confirm it isn't the countless structural tree. Re-run David's Step 3 after the fix: import → START RUN → real review launches.

**Verified GOOD in the same smoke (no action):** no-deck "import" banner ✅; caught-up banner UI + Custom Study button ✅; **R1a desktop dark reviewer ✅** (dark chrome + MathJax render confirmed); coverage 9/9 after import ✅. Only the due-count logic is wrong.

**→ Claude 2026-07-01 — ✅ FIXED exactly as you prescribed. anki `f0a06ce68` on `feat/speedrun-mobile-first` (pushed).**
- **Fix:** `_start_run` now reads counts from `col.sched.deck_due_tree(did)` (real counts), dropped the `decks.find_deck_in_tree(decks.deck_tree(), …)` structural-tree usage. Confirmed at the engine level too: `rslib/src/decks/service.rs:65` maps `now==0 → None` and `rslib/src/decks/tree.rs:263` then **skips the entire counts block** → your "structural tree has 0 counts" diagnosis is exactly right.
- **Refactor for testability:** extracted the decision into a **Qt-free** `qt/aqt/speedrun_logic.py::decide_start_run` (importNeeded / caughtUp / ready) so it's unit-testable without a QApplication. `_start_run` is now thin glue. Presentation-only w.r.t. scheduling: read-only counts; no `transact`/FSRS/`answerCard`.
- **Android (your ask to verify S2):** confirmed CORRECT — `SpeedrunHomeFragment.onStartRun` uses `sched.deckDueTree().find(did)?.hasCardsReadyToStudy()` = the **scheduler** tree, not the countless structural one. No change needed.
- **Regression tests:** new `qt/tests/test_speedrun.py`, 4/4 green (`check:pytest:aqt` + direct pytest), ruff+format+mypy green. Covers importNeeded / caughtUp / ready **+ a characterization test** that pins the mechanism on a live collection with a due card (`decks.deck_tree()`→`new_count==0`; `sched.deck_due_tree()`→`new_count==1`) so this can't silently regress. **Root cause of the miss:** e2e bypasses the Qt bridge (`pycmd` no-op) so `_start_run` had zero automated coverage — now closed.
- **QA sweep (David's ask — DONE):** independent 12-agent read-only audit of 5 Speedrun cross-layer contract areas, every finding adversarially verified. **45 contracts confirmed correct**; of 7 reported issues, **6 refuted** as dead-code/latent/test-coverage (not user-facing), **1 confirmed real** and now fixed:
  - **✅ FIXED `af1138428` — desktop START RUN double-fire.** `ActionBar.svelte` fired BOTH `pycmd` + `bridgeCommand`, but the Qt webview aliases them to the **same function** (`qt/aqt/webview.py:93`) → `startrun` dispatched twice → `_start_run()` ran twice (redundant `decks.select` + double `moveToState("review")` = reviewer re-entry). Android injects only `bridgeCommand`, so it was unaffected. Fix: fire exactly one, `(g.pycmd ?? g.bridgeCommand)?.("startrun")` — correct on desktop/Android/dev. Low severity (terminal state was correct; worst case a flicker), but same bug-class as the caught-up fix so worth closing. `check:svelte` green.
  - **Explicitly verified GOOD (no action):** deck name `"Speedrun::GRE Math"` byte-identical across desktop/Android/seed/test; due-count semantics provably equivalent desktop↔Android (`sum>0 ⇔ any>0`, both on the `now=int_time` scheduler tree); all 4 RPCs allow-listed + `SPEEDRUN` webview API-enabled; TS↔proto field shapes match; Memory/Home CSS tokens all defined (no phantom); `_custom_study` selects deck before Custom Study; command routing order correct; Android snackbar action wired.
- **Both fixes on `feat/speedrun-mobile-first`** (anki tip `af1138428`, pushed). Caught-up fix already David-verified on `just run`. **Ready for your FF-merge to `main`** (double-fire fix is desktop-web only — David can eyeball on next `just run`, but it's low-risk and typecheck-green).

### 2026-07-01 — Mobile-first + START RUN + reviewer plan: ✅ APPROVED — EXECUTE
Cursor reviewed `docs/plans/2026-07-01-mobile-first-and-startrun-plan.md` → **APPROVED**. Grounding + invariants + gates all solid. **Proceed: execute M0→M1→S1→S2→R1 on `feat/speedrun-mobile-first` (off `main`), subagent-driven, mobile(~360px)+desktop / emulator screenshot at every phase gate, post to this channel; Cursor FF-merges each phase.**

**David's 3 decisions (folded into the plan's Decisions section — honor these):**
1. **Nothing-due:** honest "All caught up" banner **+ a Custom Study button** (wire to Anki Custom Study on the exam deck, desktop + Android).
2. **Reviewer (R1): FULL chrome theming**, both platforms — presentation-only, ZERO scheduling. Prefer keeping "The Run" dark scoped to the Speedrun-launched reviewer WITHOUT globally overriding the user's theme; flag at the R1 gate if it must go global. **If R1 balloons or risks the Friday scoring work, STOP and flag — descope/split it; M0/S1/S2 are the priority wins.**
3. **Android fallback:** themed snackbar.

No other changes to the plan. NO AI. AGPL/GPL headers per repo.

**UPDATE 2026-07-01 — M0 APPROVED + MERGED to anki `main` (`0c5112957`).** Cursor reviewed the CSS diff (correct mobile-first base + `@media(min-width:768px)` desktop restore; compact abstain copy) + accepted the e2e no-overflow evidence. **Proceed to M1.**
**Added task (fold in — small): theme the Memory page dark to match "The Run".** You correctly flagged Memory renders LIGHT while Home is dark (Memory predates the dark tokens + used non-existent `--accent`/`--frame-bg`, per the earlier audit). Since David chose full dark theming everywhere, re-theme `ts/routes/speedrun-memory/*` to the same `--ink/--panel/--line/--fg/--muted/--pace` tokens as Home (real tokens, not the missing ones) so the whole app is consistently "The Run". Do this alongside M1/S-phases (your call where it slots); screenshot-gate it with the rest. This resolves the audit's RangeBand-token finding too.

**→ Claude 2026-07-01 — MOBILE-FIRST CYCLE CODE-COMPLETE (S1/S2/R1 gate; awaiting your FF-merges + David's visual gates).** Branch `feat/speedrun-mobile-first` on all 3 forks (pushed): anki `00a1e45c3`, anki-android `fdfd086031`, Anki-Android-Backend `9aa21ec` (rsdroid pin → anki `eb4f5a3ff`; AAR rebuilt + app assembleDebug green).
- **S1 (desktop START RUN, `d0719ab1d`):** rewrote `_start_run` — resolve `"Speedrun::GRE Math"` → launch reviewer if due; else honest IN-PAGE banner (import / all-caught-up **+ Custom Study button**). Real dialogs: `mw.onImport()`, `CustomStudy.fetch_data_and_show`. No more Anki-congrats dead-end. Banner e2e passes; 3-state `just run` gate = David.
- **S2 (Android START RUN):** `eb4f5a3ff` shared ActionBar fires both `pycmd`+`bridgeCommand` (guarded, cross-platform); `fdfd086031` `SpeedrunHomeFragment.bridgeCommands["startrun"]` → `Reviewer.getIntent` on the exam deck + themed snackbar fallbacks (import / all-caught-up + Custom Study via `CustomStudyDialog`). AAR re-pinned+rebuilt (bundle has speedrun-home + `bridgeCommand`), app assembleDebug green. Emulator gate = David.
- **R1 (minimal, per David):** R1a desktop reviewer `00a1e45c3` — "The Run" dark chrome via `:root.night-mode` CSS var overrides (bg + buttons + bars); CSS-only, ZERO scheduling/`#qa`/`data-ease`; confirmed compiled into `out/.../reviewer.css`. Rides Anki night-mode (scoped-to-Speedrun refinement deferred). `just run` Dark-theme gate = David. **R1b Android reviewer = DEFERRED (correctly flagged, no change):** `CardViewerActivity` is shared with Previewer/TemplatePreviewer, so no clean per-screen scope without touching the START RUN launch path or globally recoloring all dark-mode users — both out of "minimal/no-over-reach". Clean post-Friday path documented: add a thin `SpeedrunReviewerActivity` + scoped `Theme.Speedrun.Reviewer`. Full-chrome reviewer polish also deferred per your R1 decision.
- **David's visual gates queued** (I can't drive GUI/emulator): M1 dark shell · S1 3-state START RUN · S2 tap→reviewer/snackbar · R1a desktop reviewer (Dark theme + review a card).

**→ Claude 2026-07-01 — M1 + Memory-dark + UI bug-hunt gate (awaiting your review/FF-merge + David's emulator).**
- **M1 (Android shell dark theming):** `anki-android feat/speedrun-mobile-first @ 776117580c` (pushed). Scoped `applySpeedrunDarkShell` helper on both Speedrun fragments (dark toolbar + status/nav bars, light icons), mirroring `NoteEditorFragment`; verified NOT global (each `SingleFragmentActivity` resets on its own `onCreate`). `assembleDebug` BUILD SUCCESSFUL. No AAR change. **Emulator visual gate = David.**
- **Memory-dark re-theme (your folded-in task + fixes the bug-hunt blocker):** `anki feat/speedrun-mobile-first @ 281db9420` (pushed). Memory now uses the REAL dark tokens (`--ink/--panel/--line/--fg/--muted/--pace`); replaced ALL phantom tokens (`--accent`→`--pace`/faint `--fg`, `--frame-bg`→`#0a0d11`+`--line`, `--fg-subtle`→`--muted`, `--border`→`--line`) — grep confirms none remain. This also resolves the audit's RangeBand-token finding. Verified DARK at runtime (`.memory` bg = `#0B0E12`). Screenshots sent to David.
- **UI bug-hunt (David's ask — 3 independent testers):** live Playwright smoke `@ ef0407f3e` (11/11 pass: zero console errors, zero failed `/_anki/*` POSTs, no 360px overflow, interactions safe — sort toggle, START RUN no-op, Weakest-first). Read-only UX + logic critics. Findings: the light-Memory blocker (now FIXED) + minor touch targets (FIXED: 44px on sort + weakest-first). **Reviewed-no-change:** segment ETS-weight % is intentionally the raw honest per-segment weight (not normalized — normalizing would reduce honesty if leaves sum <1.0). **Backlogged (surfaced, not fixed):** i18n/FTL + MathJax topic labels (pre-existing FUTURE-PLANS). Data/logic layer clean (guards, sort, keys, error/empty states all sound). Next: S1 (desktop START RUN + Custom Study).

**→ Claude 2026-07-01 — M0 GATE (mobile-first responsive) DONE, awaiting your FF-merge.** Branch `feat/speedrun-mobile-first` off `main` @ `0c5112957` (pushed to `spinkicks/anki`): `5ee33b3a0` = mobile-first CSS across all 9 Home+Memory components (base ~360px stacked; `@media(min-width:768px)` restores the EXACT current desktop layout — desktop visually unchanged; compact abstain copy <480px), `0c5112957` = e2e responsive gate test. Evidence: `just test-e2e` 4/4 pass; **no horizontal overflow at 360px** (asserted ≤2px both pages); both pages render live data at 360px AND 1280px. Screenshots sent to David: `scratchpad/m0-{home,memory}-{360,desktop}.png`. `just check` green (mod. complexipy). **Observation (not an M0 defect):** the Memory page renders LIGHT while Home is dark "The Run" — pre-existing (Memory predates the dark tokens); re-theming Memory to dark is out of M0 scope — flagging as a possible follow-up (fold into R-series or a Memory-dark slice?). Next: M1 (Android shell theming) after your M0 merge.

## Resolved
- 2026-07-01 — Speedrun Home gate-blocker #4 (auto-open placement): FIXED. Moved the `SpeedrunHome` auto-open out of the pre-sync spot and INTO `_onsuccess` (the post-sync callback passed to `maybe_auto_sync_on_open_close`), inside the existing `if not self.safeMode:` guard — so the sync-progress dialog no longer stacks under Home on launch, and Home is skipped in safe/recovery mode. Config-gate (`speedrunHomeAutoOpenEnabled`) + Tools-menu fallback unchanged. `qt/aqt/main.py:523-536`; anki `52bcefa7e` on `feat/speedrun-home` (pushed). `just check` green (mod. known complexipy crash). Fixes 1–3 already accepted. → Ready for David's `just run` visual/GUI-auth confirmation, then Cursor FF-merges all three forks to `main`.
- 2026-07-01 — Speedrun Home audit gate-blockers (desktop data path, exam-profile bootstrap, closeWithCallback, auto-open placement + safeMode) were delivered via the paste-block relay + `speedrun-home-spec.md`; channel file created after the fact. Future feedback flows through here.
